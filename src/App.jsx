Props are a way of passing data from parent to child components, making it possible to dynamically render UI based on the data. Here, pokemon is the name of the prop that PokemonList expects, and the value being passed to it is also pokemon, which suggests that there is a variable or state named pokemon in the scope of the parent component where this snippet is used. This variable likely holds data related to a list or collection of PokÃ©mon, which PokemonList will use to render a list of PokÃ©mon in the UI.

In React Router, route parameters are defined in the path using a : symbol. Here, we have defined a pokemonId route parameter. When a user selects a pokemon link, the URL changes to include that pokemonâ€™s _id_, which is captured by the pokemonId parameter.
In short, this new <Route> tells React Router to render <PokemonDetails /> for URLs following the pattern /pokemon/1, /pokemon/2, /pokemon/3, etc.
ðŸ’¡ Notice how we are we passing the pokemon array to <PokemonDetails />. In the next section, weâ€™ll use this array combined with our pokemonId route parameter to locate and render a specific pokemon in the array. */}
